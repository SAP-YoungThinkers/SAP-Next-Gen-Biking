# next-gen Biking
SAP next-gen is a format within SAP, where students are working on orders by real customers.
The goal of the biking project is to collect anonymous data from cyclists and create a dashboard that helps to plan the new bicycle highways in the "Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar".


This iOS-application collects the data and sends it to [SAP HANA](http://www.sap.com/product/technology-platform/hana.html).
